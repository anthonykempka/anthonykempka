Hi, I’m @anthonykempka and here is where you can find my public facing GitHub projects.

I’m interested in a wide range of technical topics ranging from HW to SW and everything in between, including FW, UEFI/BIOS, OS kernels, device drivers, cloud, and AI/ML.

Over the comming weeks _(March-April 2022)_ I'm publishing a number of technical projects on GitHub. Many are past projects that people may find informative, but there are also new projects in the mix as well.

How to reach me via email is <anthony.kempka@gmail.com>
